I really enjoyed doing this project and have learnt a huge amount of CSS (I had never used CSS before Chas Academy)

I had lots of great ideas and good designs in my head, but realised later that by making my CV so big and complex (and content rich) I created myself alot of extra work with all the styling, optimising, validating - making everything responsive etc etc.
I should have probably made a smaller (more simple) CV with alot more focus on tillgänglighet and cleaner semantically (not as many divs) but Im happy with my result considering.
Next time I will make a site with SCSS - but I didnt even understand CSS when I started this - so figured at the time using vanilla CSS was my only real option for this assignment!

I have put in quite a bit of effort into tillgänglighet, I downloaded the a11y checklist and made sure I met all criteria!
  - All my links have a hover effect changing colour and/or size/form to confirm once its hovered over
  - I added a prefers reduced motion media query which stops/dissolves the animation - if the user has this setting in their browser. 
  - I made sure my table had a <caption> explaining hat the table was about
  - I meet all the criteria stated in the a11y checklist!
  - added a PREFERS REDUCED MOTION media query to remove animation for anyone who has 'reduced motions' set on their computer
  
Please ask me if you have any questions.
